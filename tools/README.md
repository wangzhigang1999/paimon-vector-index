# Release tools

This directory contains helper scripts used by release managers and committers.

## PR / base benchmark

The `PR benchmark` workflow compares the exact PR base SHA with GitHub's PR merge
commit on the same Ubuntu runner. It runs when the core, Cargo configuration, or
benchmark tooling changes. The result is
published in the Actions summary and posted as one updated bot comment, including
for external fork PRs. The comment opens with a five-row Recall/QPS table and
colored status markers. QPS drops greater than 10%/20% or recall drops greater
than 1/3 percentage points are yellow/red; these are advisory, not CI gates.
One collapsed table adds absolute QPS, P95, build time, process RSS and index size.

A separate `workflow_run` publisher runs from the default branch with comment
permission. It downloads only the triggering run/attempt's report artifact,
checks the PR against GitHub's source repository, branch and revision data, and
skips closed PRs or changed head/base revisions. It never checks out PR code,
restores PR caches, or executes artifact contents. Raw CSVs, logs, environment
metadata and machine-readable results remain available as workflow artifacts.

The publisher must first be merged into the target repository's default branch
before automatic comments can run. The PR introducing it still has its Actions
summary; subsequent runs can publish comments once the publisher is installed.

`benchmark_pr.py` builds both revisions in release mode with separate target
directories, then runs six samples per version per index. Each index is tested
in a fresh process, alternating base/candidate and candidate/base pairs. Both
versions use the candidate's `ann_bench.rs` and its support module, so a change
to the benchmark itself cannot silently change the measurement between sides.
An incompatible driver/API combination fails explicitly and needs a compatible
shared driver before results can be compared.

The initial workload is deliberately small: 10,000 synthetic 64D vectors, 4,096
training vectors, 2,048 queries, top-10, seed 42, and two Rayon threads. It covers
IVF-FLAT, IVF-SQ, IVF-PQ, IVF-RQ and DiskANN on local warm page cache. First-pass
Recall and I/O preserve the original benchmark semantics: sequential queries
follow reader optimization and one first query; batch uses a separate optimized
reader. After those complete passes warm each reader, the timing phase repeats
full sequential and batch sweeps for at least one second each. The PR report's
QPS uses the full warm timing phase. P95 uses only its first complete sequential
sweep, bounding latency storage to one sample per query. First-pass metrics
remain in the CSV.
Warm timing is enabled by `ANN_STEADY_MIN_MS=1000` and is local-storage only.
Its elapsed times and query counts are included in the CSV for verification.

This does not measure cold storage or real object-store performance. Recall is
currently measured on the first batch results. RSS is the process lifetime peak
up to build completion, including dataset and ground-truth allocations, not
index-only or search peak memory. Ground-truth IDs are copied from the retained
top-k slice to avoid retaining an N-vector allocation per query.

The report shows medians, with relative QPS changes and recall changes in
percentage points. Sample ranges are kept in the JSON artifact. A recall
drop is highlighted alongside performance. This first version is informational:
performance/recall changes do not fail CI, but build failures, timeouts, invalid
metrics, missing samples, and mismatched workload parameters do. Sample ranges
are not confidence intervals, and a reported percentage is not a statistical
significance claim. When core sources and Cargo inputs are identical, the report
explicitly labels the run as A/A repeatability calibration. Such deltas cannot
demonstrate an index-code improvement. Repeated calibration runs are needed
before choosing any timing gate.

To reproduce locally, create two **disposable** checkouts, use the same Rust
toolchain as the workflow, and run from the candidate checkout:

```bash
python3 tools/benchmark_pr.py \
  --base /path/to/disposable-base \
  --candidate /path/to/disposable-candidate \
  --output /path/to/new-results-directory
```

The script overwrites the two benchmark-driver files in the base checkout. The
output directory must not exist. `--rounds 2` provides a shorter smoke run;
`--timeout` sets the per-sample timeout in seconds (default 180).
`--total-timeout` bounds all builds and samples together (default 1,200 seconds).
Each subprocess receives the smaller of its own timeout and the remaining total
budget. On timeout, its process group is killed and a failure report is written.
The 25-minute CI job reserves time beyond this 20-minute script budget for setup
and report upload. Dataset and
index options are pinned in the script; inherited `ANN_*` settings are removed.
CI uses the same Rust stable toolchain for both revisions and records the actual
compiler version in the report. It pins the x86-64 CPU target, caches dependency
downloads only, and uploads reports even when a comparison fails.

## ANN-Benchmarks dataset conversion

`convert_ann_benchmarks.py` converts a dense
[ANN-Benchmarks](https://github.com/erikbern/ann-benchmarks) HDF5 file into
base/query `fvecs` files and the published-neighbor `ivecs` file accepted by
`core/benches/ann_bench.rs`.

The script requires `h5py` and `numpy`. For example:

```bash
python3 tools/convert_ann_benchmarks.py \
  gist-960-euclidean.hdf5 /data/gist1m \
  --prefix gist1m --query-limit 1000
```

The optional query limit applies to both queries and ground truth. It does not
truncate the indexed base vectors.

Angular/cosine datasets can be converted for the benchmark's common L2 path by
normalizing base and query vectors:

```bash
python3 tools/convert_ann_benchmarks.py \
  glove-100-angular.hdf5 /data/glove100 \
  --prefix glove100 --query-limit 1000 --normalize-l2
```

For non-zero vectors, squared L2 distance after unit normalization has the same
neighbor ordering as cosine distance. Published neighbor IDs are copied
unchanged. Conversion fails if a vector is zero-length or has a non-finite
norm.

## Java staging deploy

`deploy_java_staging.sh` deploys the Java release candidate artifacts to Apache
Nexus staging from a committer/RM machine.

GitHub Actions does **not** sign or deploy the Java staging artifacts. The
release workflow only:

1. builds the four JNI native libraries;
2. packages the multi-platform JAR and smoke-tests the final JAR without an
   external native path on all four supported platform/architecture pairs; and
3. uploads the native libraries plus the verified `java-package` JARs as
   workflow artifacts.

The committer then runs this script locally. The script checks that the release
workflow run succeeded for the current RC tag, downloads the native libraries,
and `java-package`, verifies their platform formats and legal files, places the
native libraries into the Java resource tree, and runs Maven locally. Both the
CI-generated JAR and the locally staged JAR must pass the bundled-native loader
smoke test before deployment.

### Required local setup

- `gh` GitHub CLI, authenticated with access to `apache/paimon-vector-index`;
- JDK and Maven;
- local GPG setup for the release signing key;
- Maven credentials for server id `apache.releases.https`.

Maven credentials can be supplied by one of these methods:

- configure `~/.m2/settings.xml`;
- pass `--maven-settings /path/to/settings.xml`;
- set `NEXUS_STAGE_DEPLOYER_USER` and `NEXUS_STAGE_DEPLOYER_PW` so the script can
  create a temporary Maven settings file.

### Pre-flight checks

Run these checks before the first dry-run:

```bash
gh auth status
gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format LONG
mvn --version
```

Confirm the signing key's public key is already published in Paimon KEYS:

```text
https://downloads.apache.org/paimon/KEYS
```

Confirm Maven can use server id `apache.releases.https`. A typical
`~/.m2/settings.xml` entry is:

```xml
<settings>
  <servers>
    <server>
      <id>apache.releases.https</id>
      <username>YOUR_NEXUS_TOKEN_USER</username>
      <password>YOUR_NEXUS_TOKEN_PASSWORD</password>
    </server>
  </servers>
</settings>
```

The Nexus token is from:

```text
https://repository.apache.org/ -> Profile -> User Token
```

### Find the run id

After pushing the RC tag, open the GitHub Actions run for that RC tag. Use the
`Release` workflow run triggered by the tag, for example `v0.3.0-rc1`.

The run id is the number in the workflow run URL:

```text
https://github.com/apache/paimon-vector-index/actions/runs/12345678901
```

The run id is:

```text
12345678901
```

Do not use the job id, artifact id, PR number, or commit SHA. The script checks
that this run completed successfully and that the run's commit matches the RC tag
checked out locally.

### Parameters

Required for the normal release flow:

- `--release-version 0.3.0`: Java artifact version in `java/pom.xml`. This does
  not include the RC suffix.
- `--rc 1`: RC number. Together with `--release-version`, this derives the tag
  `v0.3.0-rc1`.
- `--run-id 12345678901`: GitHub Actions run id from the RC tag's `Release`
  workflow URL. The script uses it to download the four `native-*` artifacts.

Common options:

- `--dry-run`: verify locally without signing or deploying to Nexus.
- `--maven-settings FILE`: use a specific Maven `settings.xml` containing server
  id `apache.releases.https`.
- `--staging-description TEXT`: override the Nexus staging description.
- `--no-skip-tests`: run Maven tests during dry-run or deploy.

Less common options:

- `--tag TAG`: use an explicit RC tag instead of deriving `vVERSION-rcN`.
- `--repo OWNER/REPO`: GitHub repository for `gh`; defaults to
  `apache/paimon-vector-index`.
- `--no-cleanup`: keep `java/src/main/resources/native` after the script exits.
- `--skip-native-file-check`: skip native binary format checks.

The last option is an escape hatch. Avoid it for normal releases.

### Dry-run before publishing

Always run a dry-run first with the real RC workflow artifacts:

```bash
./tools/deploy_java_staging.sh \
  --release-version 0.3.0 \
  --rc 1 \
  --run-id 12345678901 \
  --dry-run
```

Dry-run mode validates the GitHub Actions run id, downloads the native
libraries and `java-package`, and runs:

```bash
mvn clean verify -Prelease -Dgpg.skip=true -DskipTests
```

It does not sign and does not deploy to Nexus. It verifies:

- `java/pom.xml` version matches `--release-version`;
- current checkout matches the RC tag, such as `v0.3.0-rc1`;
- Java package inputs have no local changes;
- the GitHub Actions run is a successful tag-push `Release` workflow run and its
  commit matches the RC tag;
- all four native libraries are present;
- native library file formats match their target platforms;
- both the CI-generated and locally packaged JARs contain binary legal files,
  the four native libraries, and `NativeLibraryLoader`;
- both JARs load the current platform library without an external native path;
- the Java jar, sources jar, and javadoc jar are produced;
- the Java jar contains all four native library entries.

### Deploy to Nexus staging

After the dry-run succeeds, run the same command without `--dry-run`:

```bash
./tools/deploy_java_staging.sh \
  --release-version 0.3.0 \
  --rc 1 \
  --run-id 12345678901
```

The script repeats the local preflight before creating any remote staging
artifacts:

```bash
mvn clean verify -Prelease -Dgpg.skip=true -DskipTests
```

After that passes, it runs the local Nexus staging deploy:

```bash
mvn deploy -Prelease -DskipTests \
  -DstagingDescription="Apache Paimon Vector Index, version 0.3.0, release candidate 1"
```

The Maven output contains the Nexus staging repository id, for example:

```text
orgapachepaimon-XXXX
```

Use that id in the release vote email.
